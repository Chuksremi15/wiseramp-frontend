# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing `useGetActiveTransaction` hook to use React Query instead of manual polling with `useEffect` and `setInterval`. The goal is to improve code maintainability, leverage React Query's built-in caching and error handling, and provide a more robust polling mechanism for transaction status updates.

## Glossary

- **React Query**: A data fetching library for React that provides caching, synchronization, and more
- **Transaction Polling System**: The current system that periodically fetches transaction status updates
- **useGetActiveTransaction Hook**: The existing custom hook that manages transaction data fetching and polling
- **API Client**: The existing api utility used for making HTTP requests
- **Transaction Status**: The current state of a transaction (pending, completed, expired, failed)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use React Query for transaction polling, so that I can leverage its built-in caching, error handling, and optimistic updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hook is called with a valid transaction ID, THE Transaction Polling System SHALL use React Query's useQuery hook for data fetching
2. WHILE a transaction is in a non-final state, THE Transaction Polling System SHALL poll the API every 5 seconds using React Query's refetchInterval
3. WHEN a transaction reaches a final state (completed, expired, or failed), THE Transaction Polling System SHALL stop polling automatically
4. THE Transaction Polling System SHALL maintain the same API interface as the current hook (returning data, isLoading, error)
5. WHERE the hook is disabled via the enabled parameter, THE Transaction Polling System SHALL not make any API requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React Query to handle caching and deduplication, so that multiple components using the same transaction ID don't make redundant API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple components request the same transaction ID, THE Transaction Polling System SHALL use React Query's caching to avoid duplicate requests
2. THE Transaction Polling System SHALL use a consistent query key format for transaction data
3. WHEN a transaction is already cached, THE Transaction Polling System SHALL return cached data immediately while background refetching occurs
4. THE Transaction Polling System SHALL invalidate or update cache when transaction status changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling and retry logic, so that temporary network issues don't break the polling functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request fails, THE Transaction Polling System SHALL use React Query's built-in retry mechanism
2. THE Transaction Polling System SHALL continue polling even after temporary failures
3. WHEN persistent errors occur, THE Transaction Polling System SHALL expose error information through the hook's return value
4. THE Transaction Polling System SHALL maintain error state consistency with the current implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing components using the hook continue to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Transaction Polling System SHALL maintain the exact same function signature as the current hook
2. THE Transaction Polling System SHALL return the same data structure (data, isLoading, error)
3. THE Transaction Polling System SHALL accept the same parameters (transactionId, enabled)
4. THE Transaction Polling System SHALL behave identically from the component's perspective
